# LABORATORY-REACT-ZUSTAND

## Experiences

- Experience1: Official example of Zustand
  This experience is a copy and paste of the Zustand example of NPM. I made it to test if Zustand works properly

- Experience2: Testing the update of react component depending of parameters change
  This experience was for testing that if I make a store of multiple elements and call one element in each component, I dont rerender everything.

- Experience3: Persist a store over reload and change of page
  By using the middleware persist, we can easy persist a result in the locastorage
